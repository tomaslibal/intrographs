# Common types of Graphs

Some common types of graphs are discussed below. Quick recap of what a graph is:

````
    Let graph G = (V, E)

    where V is a set of vertices {v1, v2, ..., v_n}
    and E is an edge set consisting of edges such that an edge e is connecting a pair of vertices, e.g. {A, B}
````

## Utility Graph

A special kind of graph because unlike other types of graphs there is only one utility graph, which is:

Vertices: {A, B, C, X, Y, Z}

Edges: {{A, X}, {A, Y}, {A, Z}, {B, X}, {B, Y}, {B Z}, {C, X}, {C, Y}, {C, Z}}

## Cyclic Graph

Number of vertices is `v >= 3` and each vertex is connected to the next one in a cyclical manner so that each vertex has a degree of 2. There are infinitely many cyclic graphs *C_k*. The subscript *k* marks how many vertices there are in the cyclic graph.

## Null graph

Null graph has a vertex set of `{v1, v2, ..., v_n}` but no edges. Null graph is often denoted by *N_k* and a lower integer index *k* denoting how many vertices are in the graph.

## Connected Graph

Every vertex in a connected graph is mutually connected to all other vertices. There are no loops, though.

# Other graphs

There are other organizations that are usually slightly different from graphs. One of them is `digraph` which has a set of arcs where each arc represents an ordered pair `(v, w)`. This is sometimes called *a directed graph*. Each vertex in a digraph then has an indegree and outdegree which are numbers of arcs respectivelly ending and starting at that vertex.

Another structure is `multigraph` which can have multiple edges joining the same pair of vertices.

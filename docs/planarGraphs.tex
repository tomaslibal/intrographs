\maketitle

Planar graph is a graph that can be drawn geometrically on a plane without edge crossings (other than edge
crossings at the vertices). This is called \textit{embedding on a plane}~\autocite[90]{deo1974graphs}. Nishizeki
and Chiba~\autocite[11]{nishizeki2008planar} give a corollary which says that a planar graph has no vertex of
degree $ > 5 $.

By the Kuratowski's Theorem we know that a graph is planar if it does not contain subgraphs
of $ K_5 $ or UG (the utility graph, also known as $ K_{3,3} $, see Figure~\ref{fig:uggraph}). Although, this algorithm's running time will
grow exponentially to the number of edges, because it needs to check every subgraph of whose there are $ 2^m $ 
(m = num. of edges) subgraphs in every graph~\autocite[23]{nishizeki2008planar}.

An extension of this theorem is provided by Wagner who formulated that no graph containing a minor of $ K_5 $ or $ K_{3,3} $ is planar~\autocite[307]{chartrand2010graphs}.

Planarity has additional conditions such as the combinatorial dual graph conditionand others, 
see~\autocite{weisstein2009planar,weisstein1999dual}. If a graph has planar embedding, its edges can be drawn 
as straight lines~\autocite{fary1948,deo1974graphs,weisstein2009planar}.

An algorithm described in Nishizeke and Chiba~\autocite{nishizeki2008planar} which is based on vertex addition 
algorithm and uses the st-numbering algorithm and a data structure 
called PQ-tree~\autocite[33]{nishizeki2008planar} can be used for plnarity testing of biconnected graphs. 
St-numbering or source-sink numbering assigns numbers to vertices such that number 1 (source) and $ N $ (sink) 
($ N $ being the total number of vertices) are next to each other and also every node has two adjacent nodes 
such that one adj. node has a lower number and the other one has a higher number 
as Wada et al. explain~\autocite[357]{wada1997Biconnected}:

\begin{quote}
  Given an edge \textit{(s, t)} of a biconnected graph graph $ G = (V, E) $, a bijective function $ g: V \rightarrow \{ 1, 2, ..., |V|=n \} $ is called an st-numbering if the following conditions are satisfied:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item $ g(s) = 1 $, $ g(t) = n $ and
    \item every node $ v \in V - \{ s, t \} $ has two adjacent nodes $ u $ and $ w $ such that $ g(u) < g(v) < g(w) $.
  \end{itemize}

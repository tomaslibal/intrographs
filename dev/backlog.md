# Backlog tasks

## Graph properties

- [] Planarity testing
- [] BFS algorithm
- [] A* search algorithm

## Vertex and edges

- [] Edge Weight
- [] Edge Label
- [] Vertex label
- [x] Vertex drag'n'drop (reposition)

## Algorithms runner

- [] Interactively highlight a run of an algorithm (e.g. search)

## Graph creation

- [] GraphCreator.fromAdjacencyMatrix
- [] GraphCreator.fromAdjacencyList

## Layout

- [] Choose a layout algorithm window
- [] Gravity layout (higher degree = higher gravity)
- [] Vertex Size Adjustment based on the vertex degree

## Matrix operations

- [] SparseMatrix class (Yale matrix) (.fromFullMatrix(), .toFullMatrix())

## Other Presentation/Interaction

- [] zoom in/zoom out
- [] toggles for vertex/edge labels
- [] color scheme for vertices
- [] color scheme for edges
- [] Tabs/windows for full Vertex table and Edge table

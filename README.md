# Graphs

Inspired by the graph theory, this software is a graphical tool that renders graph embeddings on a plane.

The goal is to create a program that can model various graphs, lets the user
to modify them and explore their properties.

## Features

Brief overview of the features

### Graphlang

A command-line like tool for programmatic execution of instructions (to modify the graph) is included in the program. 
As there is always only one graph to work with, this graph has a symbol called *graph* or *g* for short.

Each command consists of one or more tokens. The starting symbol is a graph, vertex, or an edge, followed by a chain
of zero or more tokens. If the only token is the symbol, program will print information about it if the symbol exists.

Each command must end with a semicolon.

#### Basic vertex operations

Add an integer vertex with id:"a-forty-two-vertex" and value of 42.

```
graph.vertex.add(42, "a-forty-two-vertex");
```

Print information about the vertex.

```
"a-forty-two-vertex";
```

Add new edge. The edge is directed or un-directed which depends on the graph type.

```
graph.edge.add("a-forty-two-vertex", "some-other-vertex");
```

Is the graph directed?

```
graph.isDirected
```


## Difference between pure mathematical graphs and graphs in computer science

In pure mathematics a graph is an object that consists of the two sets:

1. Non-empty set of vertices, e.g. { A, B, C }
2. Set of edges, where each edge is defined as a subset of two vertices on which the edge is incident. This set may be empty.

From the set theory we know that the order of elements in a set does not matter.
Therefore all mathematical graphs are undirected.

Computer scientists usually use slightly different definition of a graph which
updates the second set with a set of ordered or unordered pairs. If the pair
(e.g. `(A, C)`) is ordered then the graph is directed as `(A, C)` and `(C, A)`
have different meanings in that case.

## Other tools like Gephi

[Gephi](https://gephi.github.io) is my favorite tool for graph network analysis. Although some (intended) features of `intrographs` are similar, I'm not trying to recreate Gephi. Instead of using it as a data lab for analyzing real-life data, I would like intrographs to be more an educational software which lets users run algorithms like A*, depth-first-search, etc. on various graphs.

# Graphs

Inspired by the graph theory, this software is a graphical tool that models
graphs.

The goal is to create a program that prints various graphs, lets the user
to modify them, and it should also be able to give information on some graph
properties like what type of graph it is, whether it is planar and so on.

## Features

**Graph rendering**:

- renders a graph with vertices and nodes
- "free view" by mouse drag and drop

**Properties testing**:

- connectedness tester

**Other algorithms**:

- returns an independent vertex set
- returns a spanning tree
- depth first search (DFS)

**Evaluation console**

- interprets text commands

## Difference between pure mathematical graphs and graphs in computer science

In pure mathematics a graph is an object that consists of the two sets:

1. Non-empty set of vertices, e.g. { A, B, C }
2. Set of edges, where each edge is defined as a subset of two vertices on which the edge is incident. This set may be empty.

From the set theory we know that the order of elements in a set does not matter.
Therefore all mathematical graphs are undirected.

Computer scientists usually use slightly different definition of a graph which
updates the second set with a set of ordered or unordered pairs. If the pair
(e.g. `(A, C)`) is ordered then the graph is directed as `(A, C)` and `(C, A)`
have different meanings in that case.

## Other tools like Gephi

[Gephi](https://gephi.github.io) is my favorite tool for graph network analysis. Although some (intended) features of `intrographs` are similar, I'm not trying to recreate Gephi. Instead of using it as a data lab for analyzing real-life data, I would like intrographs to be more an educational software which lets users run algorithms like A*, depth-first-search, etc. on various graphs.

# Graphs

Inspired by the graph theory, this software is a graphical tool that models
graphs.

## Difference between pure mathematical graphs and graphs in computer science

In pure mathematics a graph is an object that consists of the two sets:

1. Set of vertices, e.g. { A, B, C }
2. Set of edges, where each edge is defined as a set of two vertices which it connects.

From the set theory we know that the order of elements in a set does not matter.
Therefore all mathematical graphs are undirected.

Computer scientists usually use slightly different definition of a graph which
updates the second set with a set of ordered or unordered pairs. If the pair 
(e.g. `(A, C)`) is ordered then the graph is directed as `(A, C)` and `(C, A)`
have different meanings.
